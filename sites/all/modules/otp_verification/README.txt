INTRODUCTION
------------
OTP Verification plugin verifies Email Address/Mobile Number of users 
by sending verification code(OTP) during registration. 
It removes the possibility of a user registering with fake 
Email Address/Mobile Number. 
This plugin checks the existence of the Email Address/Mobile Number 
and the ability of a user to access that Email Address/Mobile Number.
 
= How does this plugin work? =
